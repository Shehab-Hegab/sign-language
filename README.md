## ðŸ§  Sign Language Recognition System


### Overview

This project presents a comprehensive pipeline for real-time sign language recognition using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It encompasses data collection, preprocessing, model training, and inference, aiming to bridge communication gaps for the hearing-impaired community.

### Key Features

* **Data Acquisition:** Utilizes `collect_imgs.py` to capture gesture images, facilitating the creation of a custom dataset.
* **Dataset Preparation:** Implements `create_dataset.py` to preprocess and structure the collected images for model training.
* **Model Training:** Employs `train_classifier.py` to train a classifier using the prepared dataset.
* **Inference:** Provides `inference_classifier.py` for real-time prediction of sign language gestures.
* **Model Persistence:** Saves trained models as `.p` files for easy deployment and reuse.

### Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Modeling Techniques:** Traditional machine learning classifiers (e.g., SVM, KNN)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shehab-Hegab/sign-language.git
   cd sign-language
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Data Collection Script:**

   ```bash
   python collect_imgs.py
   ```

4. **Create Dataset:**

   ```bash
   python create_dataset.py
   ```

5. **Train the Classifier:**

   ```bash
   python train_classifier.py
   ```

6. **Run Inference:**

   ```bash
   python inference_classifier.py
   ```

### Results

Achieved high accuracy in real-time sign language recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented pipeline.

### Future Work

* **Deep Learning Integration:** Incorporate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for improved accuracy.
* **Dataset Expansion:** Collect more diverse gesture data to enhance model robustness.
* **Deployment:** Develop a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
